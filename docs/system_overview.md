# System Overview: SmartShop Inventory Management System

## 1. Company Context

### Short Description of the Company

**SmartShop** is a medium-sized retail electronics store with 5 locations across the city. The company sells consumer electronics including smartphones, laptops, tablets, accessories, and home appliances. SmartShop employs approximately 50 staff members and serves around 500 customers daily across all locations.

The company focuses on providing quality products at competitive prices while maintaining good customer service. Managing inventory efficiently is critical to avoid stockouts of popular items and reduce costs from overstocking slow-moving products.

## 2. System Classification

### System Type: **Management Information System (MIS)**

### Justification of Classification

#### Users

The system serves **all levels of the organization** with routine information needs:

1. **Sales Staff (Operational Level)**
   - Record sales transactions
   - Check product availability
   - Process customer orders
   - Update inventory after each sale

2. **Store Managers (Middle Management)**
   - View daily/weekly sales reports
   - Monitor stock levels for their location
   - Identify fast-moving and slow-moving products
   - Request restocking when needed

3. **General Manager (Top Management)**
   - Review company-wide inventory status
   - Analyze sales performance across all stores
   - Make purchasing decisions for new stock
   - Track overall profitability

This **multi-level user structure** is typical of MIS, which provides information to support routine operations and management decisions across the entire organization.

#### Decisions Supported

The system supports **regular, structured decisions** that occur repeatedly:

1. **Reordering Decisions**
   - When to reorder products (based on minimum stock levels)
   - How much quantity to order
   - Which supplier to use

2. **Stock Management Decisions**
   - Which products to promote or discount
   - When to transfer stock between locations
   - Which slow-moving items to clear out

3. **Performance Monitoring Decisions**
   - Which stores are performing well
   - Which products are most profitable
   - Whether current inventory levels are adequate

These are **routine, recurring decisions** based on structured data (sales figures, stock levels, supplier information). This is characteristic of MIS, which handles regular operational and tactical decisions rather than complex, one-time strategic decisions (DSS) or customer relationship activities (CRM).

#### Outputs (Reports, Dashboards, KPIs)

The system generates **standardized reports and dashboards** typical of MIS:

**Daily Reports**
- Daily sales summary by store
- Current stock levels for all products
- Low stock alerts (items below reorder point)
- Items sold out today

**Weekly Reports**
- Weekly sales comparison (week vs. previous week)
- Top 10 best-selling products
- Inventory turnover rates
- Stock transfer requests and completions

**Monthly Reports**
- Monthly sales performance by store and product category
- Inventory aging report (slow-moving items)
- Supplier performance analysis
- Profitability by product line

**Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)**
- Total sales revenue (daily/weekly/monthly)
- Inventory turnover ratio
- Stockout frequency
- Average days in inventory
- Sales per square meter
- Gross profit margin by category

**Management Dashboard**
- Real-time stock levels across all locations
- Sales trends (graphs showing daily/weekly patterns)
- Alerts for critical stock levels
- Store-by-store performance comparison

These outputs provide **structured, routine information** that helps managers monitor operations, identify problems, and make regular business decisions. The reports are standardized, generated on a regular schedule, and focus on operational efficiency and control—all hallmarks of a Management Information System.

The system does **not** focus on:
- Complex analytical modeling or "what-if" scenarios (which would indicate DSS)
- Customer relationship tracking and marketing campaigns (which would indicate CRM)
- Integrating all business processes across departments (which would indicate ERP)

Therefore, this is clearly classified as an **MIS** designed to support routine management decisions through regular reporting and monitoring of inventory operations.
